# Assignment 8: Network Flow Problems

## Preface

I recommend using [Dinic's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinic's_algorithm) for all network flow problems in competition. It has decent performance ($O(V^2E)$ on general network, $O(\min\{V^{2/3}E,E^{3/2}\})$ on unit capacity network) and simple implementation. Reference implementations can be found [here (Chinese blog)](http://blog.csdn.net/STILLxjy/article/details/52039069) (I use this one) and [here (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dinics-algorithm-maximum-flow/).

## 1273 Drainage Ditches (1) 

Trivial network flow.

## 1274 The Perfect Stall (1) 

Trivial bipartite graph matching.
