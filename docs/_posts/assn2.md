## 1799 Yeehaa! (1)

(TODO: add a figure)

$$
r=(R-r)\sin\frac{\pi}{n}\implies r=\frac{R}{1+1/\sin\frac{\pi}{n}}
$$

## 1401 Factorial (1)

Number of trailing 0's equals to 5's power in $n!$'s factorization. We are counting how many 10's we can divide from $n!$, and $10=2\times5$, and $n!$ apparently has much more 2's than 5's, so the number of 5's is the bottleneck. The answer is 

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{\lfloor\log_5 n\rfloor} \lfloor\frac{n}{5^i}\rfloor
$$

## 2262 Goldbach's Conjecture (2)

Trivial.

## 2242 The Circumference of the Circle (2)

There are may formulas for the radius of the circumscribed circle of a triangle, but the best one for this problem is $R=\frac{abc}{4A}​$, where ​$a,b,c​$ are lengths of the three edges, and its area ​$A=\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}, s=\frac{a+b+c}{2}​$.

Refer to the Wikipedia page [Circumscribed Circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumscribed_circle#Other_properties) for more properties and formulas.

## 1654 Area (3)

(TODO: add a figure)

For each step, accumulate the area of a small triangle between the step and the original point. It can be effectively computed with vector cross product. Suppose you are at $(x,y)$ before the step, and $(x+\Delta x,y+\Delta y)$ after, the area of the triangle is $\Delta A=x\Delta y-y\Delta x$. Notice that it can be negative. That's what we called **signed area**, and we can only get the correct when using signed area, as it will cancel out areas outside the polygon when we finish a closed path.

## 2309 BST (3)

Let `lowbit(x)` be the lowest 1-bit in `x`'s binary representation (For example, `lowbit(20)==lowbit(0b10100)==0b100==4` ). Observe that the size of the subtree rooted at `x` is `lowbit(x)*2-1`, so the output is `x-lowbit(x)+1` and `x+lowbit(x)-1`.

The `lowbit` function can be efficiently computed as `lowbit(x)=x&(-x)`. It is useful in several data structures.

## 1426 Find the Multiple (6)

Let $L$ be the number of digits of $m$. The problem says $L\leq100$, but it turns out that for $1\leq n\leq200$ we can always find $m$ within the range of 64-bit integer, or $L\leq18$. Therefore, a brute force search with complexity $O(2^L)$ is enough for an AC.

A better approach resembles the backpack problem and runs in $O(nL)$. Let $\{10^i, 0\leq i \leq n\}$ be "items" and the backpack "wraps" by modulo $n$. The DP equation is `dp[i][j]=dp[i-1][j] || dp[i-1][(j-10^i)%n]`, where `dp[i][j]` means whether there is a `i`-digit `0-1` number that equals to `j` modulo `n`. We also need to keep track of the previous state of each state to recover $m$ when we find a solution.
